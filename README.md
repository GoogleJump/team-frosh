We developed an Android app that provides automation to the phone based on context. For example, when the user is at a movie theater, the brightness will automatically go down, bluetooth, wifi, and sound turns off. Once the user leaves the movie theater, all of the settings turn back on. This also works for other situations, like if the user is at a church or is driving.
