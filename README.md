==========
We developed an Android app that provides automation to the phone based on context. For example, when the user is at a movie theater, the brightness will automatically go down, bluetooth, wifi, and sound turns off. Once the user leaves the movie theater, all of the settings turn back on. 
movie theater, driving, church
brightness goes down, automated messages (maybe?), sound gets turned off
user can decide which of the settings can be changed
What you did
location services, UI

Technical challenges, % complete (i.e., if you had more time, this is what you would do)
API Package Number 19 is only compatible with Android Kit Kat
If we had more time, we would include more settings
